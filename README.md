# AI-tools-and-automation
We are two Cognitive Science students trying to understand the public view on AI technology and its implications in everyday and professional life, and we intend to make AI tools and automation on the workplace more understandable and more clear to not only us but everyone else that is interested. 

## In this github repo you will find:

A. an R-markdown explaining every line of what we did in our analysis of automation in the states

B. an R-markdown explaining every line of the barplot we did about our survey that you can find here: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1BdU8WcH1LrtyVD_zP73omj7QZa210N_vBew4eTHgUi4/edit

C. Our product that includes tips on what to expect, individual work sectors and their implications with AI in the future, and peoples' public opinion  on AI tools and automation in the workplaces

D. A folder called "data" where the data we used in R can be found. A folder called "figures" where the figures we used for our product for the exam in applied cognitive science on 2. semester
