Even if it sounds good, I really think this activity deteriorated our capacity to think critically and think on our own and I really don’t like the feeling now after using it, it almost feels like cheating, even though we won’t use the ChatGPT version of the answers. I am sure that almost each student nowadays deals with the same feeling or at least feels like their mind has an extension which works just fine without them thinking.","Maybe","It is a tool of course, that’s why it can be interpreted by some as good and by others as bad. That’s a matter of how it is going to be used by humans, but it is going to be used for bad things for sure, just because that’s how human nature is - both good and bad. The problem is that for this kind of tools, similar to social media, there must be rules and regulations that prevent bad things to happen. I am more frightened by the ability of human beings to twist this tool into evil rather than by AI’s ability to manipulate or gain conscience. The latter may also be a concern, but it won’t happen before the former. So, humans are their own enemies in a way.

As you have probably researched, people you AI to gain knowledge on certain topics. They use it as an alternative to google. The problem is that Chinas AI has been detected in censoring topics such as the massacre of Tiananmen square.
